    "Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase, before the actual code execution takes place.

    "ECMAScript 6, also known as ES6 or ECMAScript 2015, introduced several significant features and improvements to the JavaScript language. Some of the major features introduced in ES6 are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Block-Scoped Declarations (let and const): The let and const keywords were introduced to declare block-scoped variables, replacing the function-scoped var declaration. let allows reassigning values, while const declares read-only variables that cannot be reassigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrow Functions: Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. They have a shorter syntax and lexically bind the value of this, making it easier to work with function scope and this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhanced Object Literals: ES6 introduced enhancements to object literals, including the ability to define properties and methods using shorthand syntax, computed property names, and the ability to define methods directly without using the function keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "Template Literals: Template literals allow the embedding of expressions and multi-line strings in JavaScript using backticks ( ). They provide a more readable and flexible way to concatenate strings and embed variables within strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Destructuring Assignment: Destructuring assignment allows you to extract values from arrays or objects into individual variables, making it easier to work with complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules: ES6 introduced a standardized module system for JavaScript, allowing you to define and export modules using export and import statements. Modules provide better organization and encapsulation of code, making it easier to work with larger projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes: ES6 introduced class syntax, providing a more structured and object-oriented approach to creating objects and prototypes in JavaScript. Classes provide syntactic sugar over JavaScript's prototypal inheritance model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Promises: Promises were introduced as a built-in way to handle asynchronous operations. Promises represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and provide a more intuitive and readable way to work with asynchronous code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterators and Generators: Iterators and generators provide mechanisms for iterating over collections and generating sequences of values. Iterators allow you to define custom iteration behavior for objects, while generators simplify the creation of iterators using a special function syntax.\n",
